This is an old project of mine from school. I'm playing around with it and tuning it up for possible release as I learn
more about the Android platform (and working with GitHub) and also learn from past mistakes.

Honestly it's a pretty serious pile but I'm still a little proud of it, as I'm figuring everything out from scratch as I go. Planning on starting fresh soon and making the whole thing again with better planning and a nice material interface.
